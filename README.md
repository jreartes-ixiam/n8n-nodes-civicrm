CiviCRM is an open-source Constituent Relationship Management platform designed for nonprofits, NGOs, and advocacy organizations. It supports contact management, memberships, contributions, event registration, email marketing, case management, and reporting. CiviCRM integrates with WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.

## 🔐 Credentials

The node supports two authentication modes:

### **1. Standard API Key Authentication**
Simple and reliable for most use cases.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base URL** | Root URL of CiviCRM. Example: `https://crm.example.org` |
| **API Token** | Your API Key from CiviCRM (sent as `X-Civi-Auth: Bearer <token>`) |

### **2. JWT Authentication with Auto-Resolve (v3.0+)**
Time-bounded tokens for enhanced security. **Contact ID is automatically resolved** from your API Key.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base URL** | Root URL of CiviCRM |
| **API Token** | Your API Key (used to resolve Contact ID & generate JWT) |
| **Enable JWT Auth** | Toggle to enable time-bounded JWT tokens |
| **JWT Header Mode** | Where to send JWT (X-Civi-Auth recommended) |

#### How JWT Auto-Resolve Works

1. When making an API call, the node automatically:
   - Resolves your Contact ID from your API Key
   - Generates a time-bounded JWT token (1 hour default)
   - Caches both for efficiency

2. The JWT is used for API requests, with **automatic fallback to API Key** if:
   - JWT generation fails
   - JWT returns empty results
   - JWT expires

3. **Zero manual configuration** - Contact ID is detected automatically

> **Note on warnings vs. results:** When JWT auth is enabled but the token can't be obtained (e.g. AuthX disabled or misconfigured on the CiviCRM side), the node still returns data — it silently retries the same request with the API Key. You'll see a **warning in the node's output pane** explaining why JWT wasn't used, but the workflow does not fail and the query results are still shown. This is intentional: JWT failures never break a workflow, they only fall back to API Key auth and surface a non-blocking warning.

> **Troubleshooting "JWT authentication could not be obtained (no token returned by CiviCRM)":** This message covers several distinct failures on the CiviCRM side (Contact lookup by API Key failed, or `AuthxCredential.create` was denied), so it doesn't say which one occurred. The most common cause is a missing permission: the Contact that owns the API Key must have the **"AuthX: Generate new JWT credentials for other users via the API"** permission on their role — see [JWT Setup Requirements](#jwt-setup-requirements) above. To confirm which step is failing, call `Contact.get` (filtered by `api_key`) and `AuthxCredential.create` directly against your CiviCRM instance and check the HTTP status/response of each.

#### JWT Setup Requirements

**CiviCRM Extensions & Settings:**
- ✓ AuthX extension enabled (CiviCRM 5.48+)
- ✓ API Key assigned to a Contact record
- ✓ The Contact's role has the **"AuthX: Generate new JWT credentials for other users via the API"** permission (`generate any authx credential`) — under **Administer → Users and Permissions → Permissions**. Without it, `AuthxCredential.create` returns `403 Authorization failed` and the node silently falls back to API Key auth. Note that having "Administrator"/`administer CiviCRM` does **not** grant this by itself — it must be checked explicitly for the role.

**CiviCRM Authentication Configuration**

The following settings must be enabled in CiviCRM's Authentication configuration:

```
Administer → System Settings → Authentication
├─ AuthX Header Authentication: ✓ ENABLED
├─ AuthX XHeader Support: ✓ ENABLED
├─ Credential Types: Include 'jwt'
└─ XHeader Name: Set to 'X-Civi-Auth' (default)
```

**Settings in civicrm.settings.php:**
```php
// Enable AuthX for JWT tokens
define('CIVICRM_AUTHX_XHEADER_CRED', json_encode(['jwt']));

// Optional: Configure JWT signing keys (auto-generated)
// define('CIVICRM_AUTHX_SIGN_KEY', 'your-signing-key');
```

**How to Enable:**
1. Go to **Administer → System Settings → Authentication**
2. Find **AuthX Settings** section
3. Check: `✓ Enable X-Header Authentication`
4. Check: `✓ JWT in X-Civi-Auth header`
5. Verify **Header name**: `X-Civi-Auth`
6. **Save** configuration

#### JWT Token Rotation & Security

**Token Lifetime & Auto-Refresh:**
- JWT tokens auto-expire after 1 hour (configurable in n8n credential)
- n8n automatically refreshes expired tokens (transparent to workflows)
- No manual intervention needed

**Security Best Practices:**

| Action | Frequency | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Rotate API Keys** | Every 90 days | Limits exposure window if compromised |
| **Review AuthX Logs** | Monthly | Detect unauthorized access attempts |
| **Monitor JWT Usage** | Real-time | Alert on unusual patterns |
| **Update CiviCRM** | As released | Includes security patches |
| **Audit n8n Workflows** | Quarterly | Verify only needed credentials used |

**When to Regenerate Credentials:**
- ✅ Regular security rotation (quarterly)
- ✅ Suspected credential compromise
- ✅ Staff member leaves organization
- ✅ n8n instance compromised
- ✅ Failed authentication attempts detected

**How to Revoke Access Immediately:**
```
Option 1: Disable JWT (n8n credential)
├─ Uncheck "Enable JWT Auth" toggle
└─ Node falls back to API Key (effective immediately)

Option 2: Regenerate API Key (CiviCRM)
├─ Go to Contact record
├─ Regenerate API Key field
└─ Old JWT & API Key become invalid instantly
```

## 🧩 Key Features

### **1. Dynamic Field Mapping**
Supports any standard or custom field:

```
first_name = John
last_name = Doe
custom_45 = Blue
```

### **2. Smart Email, Phone & Address Mapping**
Two ways to set location-aware fields:

**(A) Simple fields**
```
email = test@example.org
phone.mobile = 600123456
address.city = Barcelona
```

**(B) Dynamic prefixes matched to CiviCRM Location Types**
```
work.email = user@company.org
billing.address.postal_code = 80331
home.phone.phone_type_id = 2
```

### **3. Default Location Type selectors**
If no prefix is used, default types are applied.

### **4. Birth Date Normalization**
Accepted input formats:

- YYYY-MM-DD
- DD/MM/YYYY
- DD-MM-YYYY
- YYYY/MM/DD
- YYYY.MM.DD

Auto-normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### **5. GET MANY with JSON Filters**
Example:
```json
[
  ["first_name", "LIKE", "Ju%"],
  ["birth_date", ">", "1990-01-01"],
  ["gender_id", "IN", [1, 2]]
]
```

### **6. Custom API Call Mode**
Example:
```json
{
  "entity": "Contact",
  "action": "get",
  "params": { "limit": 10 }
}
```

### **7. JWT Authentication with Auto-Resolve (v3.0+)**
Enhanced security with time-bounded tokens:

**Features:**
- ✨ **Automatic Contact ID Resolution** - No manual input needed
- ✨ **Time-Bounded Tokens** - 1 hour default (configurable)
- ✨ **Smart Fallback** - Automatically falls back to API Key if JWT insufficient
- ✨ **Efficient Caching** - Contact ID & JWT cached for performance
- ✨ **Zero Configuration** - Just enable "JWT Auth" toggle

**Example Workflow:**
```
Enable JWT in credential
    ↓
Make API call
    ↓
[Automatic]
├─ Resolve: Which Contact owns this API Key?
├─ Generate: Time-bounded JWT token
├─ Try: API call with JWT
└─ Fallback: If empty, retry with API Key
    ↓
Get results
```

**Security Benefits vs API Key Only:**
- ✓ Tokens expire automatically (1 hour)
- ✓ Leaked token has limited lifetime
- ✓ Can't be used outside CiviCRM
- ✓ Full audit trail available
