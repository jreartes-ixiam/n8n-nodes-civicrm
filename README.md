## 🧩 Key Features

### **1. Dynamic Field Mapping**
Supports any standard or custom field:

```
first_name = John
last_name = Doe
custom_45 = Blue
```

### **2. Smart Email, Phone & Address Mapping**
Two ways to set location-aware fields:

**(A) Simple fields**
```
email = test@example.org
phone.mobile = 600123456
address.city = Barcelona
```

**(B) Dynamic prefixes matched to CiviCRM Location Types**
```
work.email = user@company.org
billing.address.postal_code = 80331
home.phone.phone_type_id = 2
```

### **3. Default Location Type selectors**
If no prefix is used, default types are applied.

### **4. Birth Date Normalization**
Accepted input formats:

- YYYY-MM-DD
- DD/MM/YYYY
- DD-MM-YYYY
- YYYY/MM/DD
- YYYY.MM.DD

Auto-normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### **5. GET MANY with JSON Filters**
Example:
```json
[
  ["first_name", "LIKE", "Ju%"],
  ["birth_date", ">", "1990-01-01"],
  ["gender_id", "IN", [1, 2]]
]
```

### **6. Custom API Call Mode**
Example:
```json
{
  "entity": "Contact",
  "action": "get",
  "params": { "limit": 10 }
}
```
