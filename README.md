work.email = user@company.org
billing.address.postal_code = 08014
home.phone.phone_type_id = 2
```

### GET MANY with JSON filters  
Example:
```json
[
  ["first_name", "LIKE", "Ju%"],
  ["birth_date", ">", "1990-01-01"],
  ["gender_id", "IN", [1, 2]]
]
```

Accepted input formats:  
- YYYY-MM-DD

- DD-MM-YYYY

Normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
