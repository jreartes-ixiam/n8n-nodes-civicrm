## [2.1.0] — 2025-04-01 · n8n Community Node Verification (Planning)

This release applies all changes required to pass the **n8n Community Node Verification** process.

### Planning / Validation Scope

The following areas were reviewed and adapted to meet the n8n verification requirements:

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| **Node output tracking** | Added `pairedItem` to every `out.push()` call so n8n can trace items through the workflow |
| **Strict mode** | Enabled `"strict": true` in `package.json → n8n` section |
| **Credential test** | Implemented `test` block in `CiviCrmApi.credentials.ts` that calls `/civicrm/ajax/api4/Contact/get` to validate credentials on save |
| **AI agent compatibility** | Used `NodeConnectionTypes` from `n8n-workflow` to expose the correct connection types, enabling the node inside AI agent workflows |
| **TypeScript cleanup** | Removed unused imports and variables flagged by the `@n8n/node-cli` linter |
| **pnpm lockfile** | Pinned `change-case` to `4.1.2` via `pnpm.overrides` to fix `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` during build |

### Added
- `test` credential validation block — tests against `Contact/get` with a single-row limit.
- `pairedItem` field propagated in all resource handlers (`contact`, `membership`, `group`, `relationship`, `activity`, `customApi`).
- Organization name (`organization_name`) field exposed in Contact create/update operations.

### Fixed
- Email address fields were incorrectly sent to the API when the value was empty, causing unintended deletions — now skipped if blank.
- Primary location type deletion triggered when updating a contact without changing the primary — guard condition added.
- Credential test was returning false negatives due to missing `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header — corrected in `test.request`.

### Changed
- Minimum supported n8n version aligned with `n8nNodesApiVersion: 1` + strict mode requirements.
- Publish workflow updated to use a fixed `pnpm` version to avoid lockfile mismatch errors in CI.
